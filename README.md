# Interactive-Design

Concept: "Discover Your Next Favourite Podcast"

Objective: The campaign's goal is to inspire listeners to explore and find fresh podcasts on Spotify.

Design: The design will be for mobile apps. Using Spotify's app, the campaign will be created as an engaging game for customers to play. The game's instructions are as follows:

Step 1: Multiple-choice questions on the users' interests and preferences are asked of them. The inquiries might include things like:

What type of podcast are you in the mood for?
Do you prefer podcasts that are informative or entertaining?
Are you interested in true crime or history?

Step 2: Based on the users' responses, Spotify's algorithm suggests a playlist of podcasts that match their interests.

Step 3: Before picking a podcast to listen to in full, users can first listen to brief previews of each suggested podcast.

Step 4: After listening to the suggested podcast playlist, users can rate the playlist add reviews.

Step 5: Spotify will create a leaderboard showing users with the best reviews for suggested podcast playlist.

Step 6: In addition, Spotify would give discounts on premium subscriptions as a reward to users who gave the best reviews for the suggested podcast playlist.

Step 7: Users are encouraged to use a branded hashtag, such as #DiscoverYourNextFavoritePodcast, while posting about their experiences and recent discoveries on social media.

If players finish the game or share their experience on social media, Spotify may reward them with special content or other benefits to help promote the campaign.
The overall goal of this campaign is to boost the personalization and interactivity of podcast listening on Spotify, which will ultimately increase user engagement and market share for the business.
